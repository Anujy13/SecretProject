In this project , I have mainly focused on backend side , on the security and authentication of website , register, login, etc.
Technologies used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJS, NodeJS and MongoDB.

Here I have used OAuth2 to acess google API for registering the new user along with the basic registeration method and to store information in MongoDB.
